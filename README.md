# Automatic segmentation of DT-CMR short-axis images with a pre-trained U-Net

## Introduction

This repository contains a python script that automatically segments cardiac mid-ventricular short-axis diffusion tensor images. It loads a pre-trained U-Net[1] based convolutional neural network (CNN). This CNN was trained by the cardiac diffusion team at the Royal Brompton Hospital.

## Usage
This CNN is intended to be used with the scan mean image (average of all acquired diffusion images after co-registration). It also seems to work well for individual diffusion images if they are strongly denoised with a non-local means algorithm [2].

The network was trained with mid-ventricular STEAM images acquired at 3T. The input image shape must be a rectangular field of view with (256, 96) pixels (grayscale). For more information please see the following article:

An example scan mean image is provided:

We are confident the U-Net will work with data from other centers provided a similar protocol is used: resolution, field strength and a STEAM based sequence. 

Although untested, we do not expect good results from a spin-echo based sequence as the image contrast will be quite different, in particular the blood signal in the LV and RV cavity. If enough data is available we suggest widely used transfer learning-based methods.  

## Requirements

- CNN HDF5 file can be downloaded from here: [3] (400 MB).
- Tensorflow (v1.14), numpy, matplotlib

Tested in Python 3.6 (anaconda) with macOS Catalina.
