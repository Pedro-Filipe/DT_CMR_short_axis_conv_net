# Automatic segmentation of DT-CMR short-axis images with a pre-trained U-Net

## Introduction

This repository contains a python file that loads a pre-trained U-Net [1] based convolutional neural network (CNN). This CNN was trained to segment different regions of a cardiac mid-ventricular short-axis diffusion tensor image.

This CNN is intended to be used with the scan mean image: average of all acquired diffusion images after co-registration. It also seems to work well for individual diffusion images if they are denoised with a non-local means denoising algorithm [2].

An example scan mean image is provided and this is the output from the segment.py file:

Requirements:

- CNN HDF5 file can be downloaded from here: [3].
- tensorflow (v1.14), numpy, scipy

Tested in Python 3.6 (anaconda) with macOS Catalina. 

Please feel free to use it and commit any suggestions.
