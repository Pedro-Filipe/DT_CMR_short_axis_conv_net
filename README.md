# Automatic segmentation of DT-CMR short-axis images with a pre-trained U-Net

## Introduction

This repository contains a python file that automatically segments cardiac mid-ventricular short-axis diffusion tensor images. It loads a pre-trained U-Net [1] based convolutional neural network (CNN). This CNN was trained by the cardiac diffusion team at the Royal Brompton Hospital.

*A: U-Net based CNN architecture. B: Example of segmented classes in a short-axis image.*

## Usage
This CNN is intended to be used with the scan mean image (average of all acquired diffusion images after co-registration). It also seems to work well for individual diffusion images if they are strongly denoised with a non-local means algorithm [2].

The network was trained with STEAM images acquired at 3T. The input image shape must be a rectangular field of view with (256, 96) pixels. For more information please see the following article:

An example scan mean image is provided:

*Input and output of the segment.py script.*

## Requirements

- CNN HDF5 file can be downloaded from here: [3] (400 MB).
- Tensorflow (v1.14), numpy, matplotlib

Tested in Python 3.6 (anaconda) with macOS Catalina.
